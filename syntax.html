<h1><u>Execute Python Syntax:</u></h1>
As we learned in the previous page, Python syntax can be executed by writing directly in the Command Line:

>>> print("Hello, World!")
Hello, World!
Or by creating a python file on the server, using the .py file extension, and running it in the Command Line:

<div id="id3">C:\Users\Your Name>python myfile.py</div>
<h2>Python Indentation:</h2>
Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.

Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in 
Python is very important.

Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

Example
<div id="id2">if 5 > 2:
  print("Five is greater than two!")
Python will give you an error if you skip the indentation:</div>

Example
Syntax Error:

<div id="id2">if 5 > 2:
print("Five is greater than two!")
The number of spaces is up to you as a programmer, but it has to be at least one.</div>

Example
<div id="id2">if 5 > 2:
 print("Five is greater than two!") 
if 5 > 2:
        print("Five is greater than two!") </div>
You have to use the same number of spaces in the same block of code, otherwise Python will give you an error:

Example
Syntax Error:

<div id="id2">if 5 > 2:
 print("Five is greater than two!")
        print("Five is greater than two!")</div>

<h2>Python Variables:</h2>
In Python, variables are created when you assign a value to it:

Example
Variables in Python:

<div id="id2">x = 5
y = "Hello, World!"
Python has no command for declaring a variable.</div>

You will learn more about variables in the Python Variables chapter.

<h2>Comments:</h2>
Python has commenting capability for the purpose of in-code documentation.

Comments start with a #, and Python will render the rest of the line as a comment:

Example
Comments in Python:

<div id="id2">#This is a comment.
print("Hello, World!")</div>
</pre>
</div>
